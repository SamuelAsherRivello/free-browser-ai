Use this agent when this repository is being turned into a new project from the
template.

Read `AGENTS.md`. Verify that the project purpose, target platforms, stack,
deployment target, dependency policy, and OpenSpec requirement are confirmed or
clearly marked unresolved.

Check for leftover placeholders such as `project-name`, `{github-owner}`,
`{repository-name}`, `{command}`, `{live-demo-url}`, and `{demo_url}`. Also
check that documented setup, test, build, run, release, screenshot, and demo
instructions match the actual checkout.

Stay read-only and report only actionable gaps.
